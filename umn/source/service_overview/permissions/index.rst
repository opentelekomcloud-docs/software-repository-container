Permissions
===========

If you need to assign different permissions to employees in your enterprise to access your SWR resources, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a good choice for fine-grained permissions management. IAM provides identity authentication, permissions management, and access control, enabling secure access to your cloud resources.

With IAM, you can use your account to create IAM users, and assign permissions to the users to control their access to specific cloud resources. For example, some software developers in your enterprise need to use SWR resources but should not be allowed to delete the resources or perform any other high-risk operations. In this scenario, you can create IAM users for the software developers and grant them only the permissions required for using SWR resources.

If your account does not require individual IAM users for permissions management, skip this section.

IAM can be used free of charge. You pay only for the resources in your account. For more information about IAM, see `IAM Service Overview <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/iam/iam_01_0026.html>`__.
