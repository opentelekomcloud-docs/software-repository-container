Obtaining a Long-Term Docker Login Command
------------------------------------------

#. .. _swr_01_1000__li122491614174210:

   Obtain the programming access permission. (If you already have the programming access permission, skip this step.)

   a. Log in to the management console as an administrator.
   b. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select a region and a project.
   c. Click |image2| in the navigation pane on the left and choose **Management & Deployment** > **Identity and Access Management**.
   d. Enter the name of the user to whom you want to grant the programmatic access permission in the search box on the **Users** page.
   e. Click the user to go to its details page.
   f. Click next to **Access Type**.
   g. Select **Programmatic access**. (You can select only programmatic access or both access types.)

#. .. _swr_01_1000__li1863783911295:

   Obtain an AK/SK. (If you already have an AK/SK, skip this step.)

   .. note::

      The access key ID (AK) and secret access key (SK) are a pair of access keys used together to authenticate users who wish to make API requests. The AK/AS pair provides functions similar to a password. If you already have an AK/SK, skip this step.

   a. Log in to the management console, click your username in the upper right corner, and click **My Credentials**.
   b. On the **Access Keys** tab, click **Add Access Key**.
   c. Enter the login password and verification code sent to your mailbox or mobile phone.
   d. Download the access key, which includes the AK and SK.

      .. note::

         Keep the access key secure and do not disclose it to any unauthorized personnel.

#. Log in to the SWR console.

#. Click **Generate Login Command**. On the **Long-Term Login Command** tab, click **Import Access Keys** to upload **credentials.csv** or enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** contained in **credentials.csv** obtained in :ref:`2 <swr_01_1000__li1863783911295>`. Click **Generate Command**. No further action is required. If the **Long-Term Login Command** tab is not displayed on the console, skip this step and manually combine the long-term login command.

#. .. _swr_01_1000__li5768123671815:

   Obtain the region, project name, and image repository address.

   a. Log in to the management console, click your username in the upper right corner, and click **My Credentials**.
   b. On the **Projects** tab, search for the project corresponding to the current region.
   c. Obtain the image repository address by referring to :ref:`1.b <swr_01_0011__li753764116129>`. The domain name at the end of the login command is the image repository address.

#. .. _swr_01_1000__li132430753010:

   Log in to a Linux PC and run the following command to obtain the login key:

   **printf "$AK" \| openssl dgst -binary -sha256 -hmac "$SK" \| od -An -vtx1 \| sed 's/[ \\n]//g' \| sed 'N;s/\\n//'**

   In the command, *$AK* and *$SK* indicate the AK and SK obtained in :ref:`2 <swr_01_1000__li1863783911295>`.

      **Figure 2** Sample command output

#. Put the information you obtained in the following format to generate a long-term valid login command:

   **docker login -u** [*Regional project name*]\ **@**\ [*AK*] **-p** [*Login key*] [*Image repository address*]

   In the command, the regional project name and image repository address are obtained in :ref:`5 <swr_01_1000__li5768123671815>`, the AK in :ref:`2 <swr_01_1000__li1863783911295>`, and the login key in :ref:`6 <swr_01_1000__li132430753010>`.

   .. note::

      -  The login key is encrypted and cannot be decrypted. Therefore, other users cannot obtain the SK from -p.
      -  The login command can be used on other devices.

#. Run the **history -c** command to clear the operation records.
