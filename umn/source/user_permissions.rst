User Permissions
================

Scenarios
---------

To manage SWR permissions, you can use Identity and Access Management (IAM). If you have the SWR Admin or Tenant Administrator permission, you become an admin user of SWR. You can grant permissions to other IAM users in SWR.

If you are not an SWR admin user, you can request an SWR admin user to grant you permissions to read, write, or manage a specific image or images in a specific organization.

.. note::

   -  An admin user is granted image management permission of all organizations by default, even if the user is not in the authorized user list of the organizations.
   -  SWR is deployed and accessed in specific physical regions. To assign permissions to a user group, specify the scope as region-specific projects and select projects for the permissions to take effect.

Authorization Method
--------------------

You can grant permissions to users in SWR by using either of the following methods:

-  :ref:`Grant permissions on an image details page <swr_01_0015__section851514354541>` to allow users to read, write, and manage a specific image.

-  :ref:`Grant permissions on an organization details page <swr_01_0015__section950354645517>` to allow users to read, write, and manage all the images in an organization.
