What Are the Differences Between Long-Term Valid Login Commands and Temporary Login Commands?
=============================================================================================

-  Temporary login commands will expire after 24 hours.
-  Long-term valid login commands are valid for a year.

After you obtain a long-term valid login command, your temporary login commands will still be valid as long as they are in their validity periods.

The long-term valid and temporary login commands can be used by multiple users to log in to the system at the same time.
