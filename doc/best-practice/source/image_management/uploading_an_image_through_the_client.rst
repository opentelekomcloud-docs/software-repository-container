Uploading an Image Through the Client
=====================================

Scenario
--------

This section walks you through the steps of uploading an image to SWR through the client by taking the **nginx:v1** image built in :ref:`Basics of the Container Engine <swr_01_0006>` as an example. Uploading an image through the client is to run Docker commands on the client where Docker is installed to push the image to an image repository of SWR.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  Each image layer uploaded through the client cannot exceed 10 GB.
-  The Docker client version must be 1.11.2 or later.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have created an organization in SWR. For details, see :ref:`Creating an Organization <swr_01_0014__section12921632181415>`.
-  If you use an ECS that is not a CCE node to connect to SWR using a private network address, configure **insecure-registries** as follows:

   #. Modify the **/etc/docker/daemon.json** file. If the file does not exist, manually create it. Add the following content to the file:

      .. code-block::

         {
             "insecure-registries": [
                 "{Intranet address}"
             ]
         }

      To obtain the value of {*Intranet address*}, log in to the SWR console. On the **Dashboard** page, click **Generate Login Command** and obtain the private network address in the private network command.

      .. note::

         If **insecure-registry** has been configured in the **DOCKER_OPTS** configuration item in the **/etc/default/docker** file, you do not need to modify the **/etc/docker/daemon.json** file.

         Run the following command to add the private network IP address to the end of the **DOCKER_OPTS** configuration item:

         **vi /etc/default/docker**

         Example:

         .. code-block::

            # Use DOCKER_OPTS to modify the daemon startup options. DOCKER_OPTS="--insecure-registry={existing configurations} --insecure-registry={Intranet address}"

   #. Restart Docker for the configuration to take effect.

      **sudo systemctl daemon-reload**

      **sudo systemctl restart docker**

   Access SWR.

   a. Log in to the SWR console and the VM running the container engine as the **root** user.

   b. .. _swr_01_0011__en-us_topic_0112596104_li182568055016:

      In the navigation pane on the left, choose **My Images** and then click **Upload Through Client**. On the page displayed, click **Generate a temporary docker login command** and click |image1| to copy the command.

      .. note::

         -  A temporary login command is valid for 24 hours. For details about how to obtain a login command that will remain valid for a long term, see :ref:`Obtaining a Long-Term Valid Login Command <swr_01_1000>`. After you obtain a long-term valid login command, your temporary login commands will still be valid as long as they are in their validity periods.
         -  The domain name at the end of the login command is the image repository address. Record the address for later use.

   c. Run the **docker login** command on your Docker client (a device that has Docker installed).

      The message "Login Succeeded" will be displayed upon a successful login.

#. Run the following command on the device where Docker is installed to label the **nginx** image:

   **docker tag** *[Image name 1*:*tag 1]* *[Image repository address]*/*[Organization name]*/*[Image name 2*:*tag 2]*

   In the preceding command:

   -  [Image name 1:tag 1]: Replace it with the actual name and tag of the image to upload.
   -  [Image repository address]: You can query the address on the SWR console, that is, the domain name at the end of the login command in :ref:`1.b <swr_01_0011__en-us_topic_0112596104_li182568055016>`.
   -  [Organization name]: Replace it with the name of the organization created.
   -  [Image name 2: tag 2]: Replace it with the desired image name and tag.

   Example:

   **docker tag nginx:v1 swr.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/group/nginx:v1**

#. Push the image to the image repository by running the following command:

   **docker push** *[Image repository address]*/*[Organization name]*/*[Image name* 2:*tag 2]*

   Example:

   **docker push swr.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/group/nginx:v1**

   The following information will be returned upon a successful push:

   .. code-block::

      6d6b9812c8ae: Pushed
      695da0025de6: Pushed
      fe4c16cbf7a4: Pushed
      v1: digest: sha256:eb7e3bbd8e3040efa71d9c2cacfa12a8e39c6b2ccd15eac12bdc49e0b66cee63 size: 948

   To view the pushed image, refresh the **My Images** page.
