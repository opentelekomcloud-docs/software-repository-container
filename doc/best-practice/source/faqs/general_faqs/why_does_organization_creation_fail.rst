Why Does Organization Creation Fail?
====================================

Symptom: The creation of an organization fails, and a message is displayed indicating that the organization already exists. However, the organization is not found on the **Organizations** page.

Solution: Change the organization name to one which is globally unique in the Region.

If a message is displayed indicating that the organization already exists, the organization name may have been used by another user. Use another organization name.
