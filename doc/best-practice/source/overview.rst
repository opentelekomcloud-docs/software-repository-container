SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) allows you to easily manage the full lifecycle of container images and facilitates secure deployment of images for your applications.

SWR provides private image repositories and fine-grained permission management, allowing you to grant different access permissions, namely, read, write, and edit, to different users.
