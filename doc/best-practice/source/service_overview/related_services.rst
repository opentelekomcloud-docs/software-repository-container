-  Cloud Container Engine (CCE)

   CCE is a high-performance, high-reliability service through which enterprises can manage containerized applications. CCE supports native Kubernetes applications and tools, allowing you to easily set up a container runtime environment on the cloud.

   SWR works seamlessly with CCE to allow you to deploy your images held by SWR on CCE clusters.

-  Cloud Trace Service (CTS)

   CTS generates traces to enable you to get a history of operations performed on cloud service resources. The content of a trace includes operation requests sent using the management console or open APIs as well as the operation results. You can view all generated traces to query, audit, and backtrack performed operations.

   With CTS, you can record operations associated with SWR for future query, audit, and backtrack operations.
