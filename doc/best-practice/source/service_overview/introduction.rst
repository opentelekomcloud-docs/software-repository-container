Introduction
============

SoftWare Repository for Container (SWR) allows you to easily manage the full lifecycle of container images and facilitates secure deployment of images for your applications.

SWR can either work with CCE or be used as an independent container image repository.

Features
--------

-  **Full lifecycle management of images**

   SWR manages the whole lifecycle of your container images, including push, pull, and deletion.

-  **Private image repository and access control**

   Private image repository and fine-grained permission management allow you to grant different access permissions, namely, read, write, and edit, to different users.

-  **Large scale image distribution acceleration**

   SWR uses the image pull acceleration technology to ensure faster image pull for CCE clusters in high concurrency scenarios.

Accessing SWR
-------------

The cloud platform provides a web-based management console and HTTPS-based APIs through which you can access the SWR service.

-  Using APIs

   If you want to integrate SWR into a third-party system for secondary development, use APIs to access SWR. For details, see *SWR API Reference*.

-  Using the management console

   Use this mode if you do not want to integrate SWR into a third-party system.
